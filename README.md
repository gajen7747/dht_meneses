# dht_meneses

This is an experimental development by Alejandra Meneses to read DHT11 Humidity and Temperature Sensor through an Intel Galileo IoT computer and report it through the cloud via pvCloud by costaricamakers.com and via email/web app.

This exemplifies the implementation of Sensor > Device > Cloud > App cycle.

## Whats in here

This repository holds two code sets: (1) the ARDUINO sketch and related libraries for reading the DHT11 sensor in Intel Galileo and (2) A web application that performs the reading of pvCloud "Last Value" of the sensor and interprets it into red/organge/green type of visual indicator for given triggers.
