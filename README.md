This is an experimental development by Alejandra Meneses to read DHT11 Humidity and Temperature Sensor through an Intel Galileo IoT computer and report it through the cloud via pvCloud by costaricamakers.com and via email/web app.

This exemplifies the implementation of Sensor > Device > Cloud > App cycle.
